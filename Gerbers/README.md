This is everything you need to create a PCB of our DC25 badge. 

However, soldering this PCB is not for a novice. It requires a stencil and reflow. **This is not optional**. 

Take care when placing the BMD-300. Most of our complete failures were due to pillowing of the solder paste or inaccurate placement. Usually this results in a slight short between VCC and GND. Or, in a few cases, one or more button will not work, MicroSD is unreadable, or display will not show anything.

As of the end of DC25, the cost for three of these PCBs from OSH Park was $160 while China can be as cheap as $60 for ten.
